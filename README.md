# ScratchAddons-Safari
We all know the Scratch Addons extension for Chrome, and working on Firefox, but what about us Safari users? What I did is compiled scratch addons for Safari. It looks the same and works the same as it's chrome counterparts, but now you don't need to switch browsers on your Mac if you prefer Safari!

### Notice:
The .xcodeproj is zipped, so it has to be unzipped for use, sorry for the inconvinience

### Building from source:
To build this from source, you need to have `Xcode` installed on your mac computer. For best compatiblity, it's recommened to have version 12 or newer. When you do, open the project, and simply run the project. Then, it'll do it's thing and compile

### Running the extension
Note: As of now, this only works on macOS

To run the extension, you need to go to `Safari, Preferences, Advanced, Show Develop in menu bar`, and once you do that, then go to `Develop, Allow Unsigned Extensions`. And after that, finally go to `Safari, Extensions` and check off Scratch Addons
