# ScratchAddons-Safari
We all know the Scratch Addons extension for Chrome, and working on Firefox, but what about us Safari users? What I did is compiled scratch addons for Safari. It looks the same and works the same as it's chrome counterparts, but now you don't need to switch browsers on your Mac if you prefer Safari!
